 *
 * This deliberately lives outside any ViewModel. It used to be a method on
 * [com.looker.droidify.compose.externalApps.ExternalAppsViewModel], which meant it could only ever run
 * while a screen was open: external sources had no background update check at all, and an app whose
 * source published a new release only learned about it the next time the user happened to open Omnify.
 * A ViewModel needs a ViewModelStoreOwner, which a headless worker has none of, so the work had to move
 * here to be schedulable. The ViewModel now delegates to this, so the foreground and background paths
 * are the same code rather than two implementations that can drift apart.
