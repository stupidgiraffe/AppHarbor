 * Android source at all, such as brave/brave-browser, whose own README says it exists only for
 * issues, releases and the wiki, with the actual source kept in a different repository entirely.
 * Hyphens and underscores become spaces, and each resulting word is capitalised.
 *
 * A single already mixed-case word (NewPipe, K9Mail, microG) is left untouched, since that already
 * reads as a deliberately chosen style rather than a raw slug; only a plain lowercase one gets its
 * first letter capitalised.
