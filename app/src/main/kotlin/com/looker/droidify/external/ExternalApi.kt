 * GitHub's "alert" blockquotes (`> [!NOTE]` / `[!TIP]` / `[!IMPORTANT]` / `[!WARNING]` / `[!CAUTION]`
 * as the sole content of a blockquote's first line) are a GitHub-specific convention layered on top of
 * plain blockquote syntax, not something CommonMark itself understands — without this they'd render as
 * an ordinary quote showing the literal marker text. They're pulled out and rendered on their own before
 * the main parse, then spliced back in as the styled callout (see [extractAlertBlockquotes]);
 * [ReadmeWebView]'s CSS already ships the matching `.markdown-alert*` classes, mirroring github.com's
 * own look, for every provider — the syntax isn't GitHub-exclusive; Codeberg/Gitea and GitLab READMEs
 * use the same convention.
